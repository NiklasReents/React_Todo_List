## Description

This is a little React-based todo-list where you can create, edit, delete and mark todo-items as done (the delete function needs to be created yet). Future versions will add little element tooltips, make it possible for users to drag and drop todo-items for rearrangement and will also include a function that assigns flags to todo-items in order to add them to predefined and filterable todo categories (e.g. "work", "family" etc.).
