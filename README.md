## Description

This is a little React-based todo-list where you can edit existing todo-items, delete them and mark them as done (currently, the latter function does not work properly on all but the first toto-item). Future versions will make it possible for users to add new todo-items to the existing todo-list (currently the total number of todo-items is hard-coded) and might also include adding a picture to a toto-item via file upload.
