## Description

This is a little React-based todo-list where you can create, edit, delete and mark todo-items as done (currently, the latter function does not work properly on all but the first todo-item). Future versions will add little element tooltips, make it possible for users to drag and drop todo-items for rearrangement and might also include adding a picture to a todo-item via file upload etc.
